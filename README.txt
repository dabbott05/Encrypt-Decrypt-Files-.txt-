In this project there are 2 programs, one to encrypt a .txt file, and one
to decrypt the new encrypted .txt file.

It will create 3 new .txt files.

keyFile.txt - this will be created to store your created key. using this key
will allow you too decrypt the file you previously encrypted. If you encrypt
your file and lose the key YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DECRYPT THE FILE.

encryptedFile.txt - this will be created to store the contents of the file that
you wish to be encrypted. The file will apear to look like random characters but
using the key it will restore the file to its original contents.

decryptedFile.txt - this will create a file after you decrypt the file previously encrypted.
the contents will contain an identical file to the one you originally wanted encrypted.

RECOMMENDED INSTRUCTION:
Once you have created your keyFile.txt and have encrypted your file, store your
encryptedFile.txt on your device and store the keyFile.txt on a microUSB drive. 
At this point it is safe to delete the original file you had encrypted.
This will ensure maximum security to your files.

WARNINGS:
DO NOT LOSE keyFile.txt
DO NOT SHARE keyFile.txt
DO NOT LOSE encryptedFile.txt
